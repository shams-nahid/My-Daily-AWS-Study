## Security

- User Based
  - `IAM policy` determine, which `API` calls are allowed from console
- Resource Based
  - Allow Cross Account
  - Object Access Control List (Object ACL) is finer grain
  - Bucket Access Control List (Bucket ACL) is less common
- A `IAM` principal allow access `S3` if
  - Any `IAM` permission allow
  - Any `Resource Policy` allow
  - No explicit deny in anywhere
- Supports `VPC Endpoint`, do it is possible to interact with `S3` without public internet
- `API Calls` can be logged by `Cloud Trail`
- `S3 Access Logs` can be stored in another `S3 Bucket`
- User can use `MFA` to prevent unintended deletion
- `Presigned URL` can be used for premium content
  - `Presigned URL` is generated by user credential token
  - It is valid for limited time

## Bucket Policy

- JSON Based Policy
- Keys in the `Policy`
  - `Effect` means is the action `Allowed` or `Denied`
  - `Principal` means who is trying to access/taking-actions
    - It can be
      - User
      - Resource

    - Can be
      - READ Object
      - GET Object (single/multiple)
      - UPDATE Object
      - DELETE Object
  - `Resource` means on which `Bucket` or `Object` is targeted
- Hands On `Object can not be uploaded if it is not SSE-S3`
  - `Effect` should be `Deny`
  - The `Principal` be `*`, since it is applicable for anyone
  - `Service` is `AWS S3`
  - `Action` be `S3 Put Object`
  - `ARN` should be `s3://bucket_name/*`
  - We have to deny if it does not match two condition
    - The header `x-aws-server-side-encryption` can not be null
    - The header `x-aws-server-side-encryption` is not equal `AES-256`

## Bucket Settings for Block Public Access

- Use to prevent company data leaks
- We can block public access to a bucket through (No need to remember the names)
  - new ACL
  - any ACL
  - new Public Bucket
  - Access Point Policies
