## Encryption

- 4 types of `Encryption` is available
  - `SSE-S3`
    - Server side encryption handled by `AWS` (`S3`)
    - Data key is managed by `S3`
    - Use `AES-256` algorithm
    - Header should be `x-amz-server-side-encryption: AES-256`
    - Completely free
  - `SSE-KMS`
    - Server side encryption
    - Key is managed by `KMS`
    - Header should be `x-amz-server-side-encryption: aws:kms`
    - Useful because
      - Using `KMS`, we can determine who has access keys
      - Audit Trail
  - `SSE-C`
    - Server side encryption
    - Key is provided by us
    - `S3` does not store the key
    - Must be use `HTTPS`
      - Since every time we pass the `Encryption Key` using `HTTP Header`
  - Client Side Encryption
    - We encrypt the object before uploading
    - We decrypt object after retrieving from the `S3`
    - To `encrypt` and `decrypt` object in client we can use
      - `S3 Encryption Client`
      - Or other tools
- `Encryption in Transit`
  - Also known as `SSL/TLS`
  - `S3` exposes both
    - `HTTP`
    - `HTTPS`
- `Default Encryption`
  - We can use `Bucket Level Default Encryption`
  - So any object uploaded to the bucket will be automatically encrypted, even though the we do not pass appropriate `header`
  - Default encryption only accepts
    - `SSE-S3`
    - `SSE-KMS`
  - It does not accept `SSE-C` and `Client Side Encryption` as `Default Encryption`
  - `Bucket Policy` evaluated before the `Default Encryption`
  - `Bucket Policy` is the old way of `Default Encryption`
- Example of in house key management for `S3`
  - Create customer managed `CMK`
  - Encrypt data with the `CMK`
  - Store encrypted data and data key in `S3`
  - Delete the data keys
  - For decrypt, use CMK to decrypt `data key`
  - Now delete the data using the `Decrypted data key`
