## CI/CD

- Flow
  - Code -> Build -> Test -> Deploy -> Provision
- `AWS Codepipeline`
  - `AWS Codecommit`
    - Like `Github`
    - Responsible for `Code` portion
  - `AWS Codebuild`
    - Like `Jenkins`
    - Responsible for `Build` and `Test` portion
  - `AWS Code Deploy`
    - Responsible for `Deploy` portion
    - Ues `AWS Beanstalk` or `AWS Cloudformation` to provision the code
    - Can be use for deploying code to
      - EC2 Instance
      - On premise sever
      - Lambda Function
    - Use for
      - Rapid release of new feature
      - Updating `Lambda Function`
      - Avoid downtime during Application deployment
    - Type of code deploy
      - Linear (This deployment send traffic incrementally)
      - All at once (All traffic shifts to new deployment)
      - Canary (Can be define, how many traffic will flow new and updated deployments)
- While deploying a code base
  - `Code commit` can be a source stage
  - `Beanstalk` can be a deploy stage
- `Blue/Green` Deployment
  - Isolation between `blue` and `green`
  - Roll incoming traffic during deployments
  - Minimum downtime
