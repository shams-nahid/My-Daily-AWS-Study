## Athena Vs Select

Both can run SQL. But S3 Select run very simple `SQL Statements` whereas Athena can run complex `SQL Query`

### Athena

- `Athena` used for data analytics
- Analytics is happening in directly `S3`
- Serverless service

### S3 Select

- `S3 Select` is for `Data Filtering`
- Not-serverless, it's server-side filtering
