## Blocking IP Address

- For `EC2` instance
  - `NACL` in `Subnet Level`
  - `Security Group` in `Instance Level`
  - Run `Firewall Software` in `EC2` instance
    - This includes `CPU` cost
- When using a `ALB`
  - `NACL` in `Subnet Level`
  - `Security Group` in `ALB`
    - `Security Group` does not work in the `instance` level, it only shows the `ALB IP`
  - `WAF` in `ALB`
    - Can be used for `IP Filtering`
- When using a `NLB`
  - `NACL` in `Subnet Level`
  - `Security Group` in `Instance Level`
  - Run `Firewall Software` in `EC2` instance
    - This includes `CPU` cost
- When using a `Cloudfront`
  - `NACL` and `Security Group` does not work here
    - `NACL` and `Security Group` only sees the `Cloudfront IP` and `ALB IP` respectively
  - `Cloudfront Geo Restriction`
  - `WAF` in `Cloudfront`
    - Can be used for `IP Filtering`
