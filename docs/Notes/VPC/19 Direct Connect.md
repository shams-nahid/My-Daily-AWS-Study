## Direct Connect

- Provide `Dedicated Private Connection` from `Remote Network` to `VPC`
- Need to establish physical connection between `Corporate Data Center` and `AWS Direct Connect Location`
- `Corporate Data Center` => `AWS Direct Connect Location` => `VPC`
- In `VPC` a `Virtual Private Gateway` is required
- `DC` allow both `Public` and `Private` resources
- Supports `IPv4` and `IPv6`
- Two types of `DC` available
  - `Dedicated Connection`
    - Bandwidth be `1Gbps` to `10Gbps`
    - A dedicated physical `ethernet port` will be available in `AWS` for the customer
    - To establish `Dedicated Connection`, first request `AWS` and complete by `AWS Direct Connect Partners`
  - `Hosted Connection`
    - To establish `Hosted Connection`, don't need to request `AWS`, can be completed by `AWS Direct Connect Partners`
  - `Hosted Connection`
- `Direct Connect` is a time consuming process (approximately 1 month)
- Encryption
  - `Data In Transit` is not `encrypted`
  - `Data In Transit` is private between `Corporate Data Center`, `Direct Connect Partner` and `AWS Cloud`
  - Encryption can be established by `IPsec-encrypted` private connection
    - `IPsec-encryption` is combination of `Direct Connect` and `VPN`
    - This `VPN` is between `Corporate Data Center` and `AWS Direct Connect Partner`
- Used for
  - Increase bandwidth throughput
    - Working with large data set
    - lower bandwidth cost
  - Consistent network to avoid
    - data drops
    - connection shut down
    - real time data feeds
  - Hybrid environments (`On Premise Data Center` and `Cloud Data Center`)
- `LAG` can be used to aggregate maximum throughput
